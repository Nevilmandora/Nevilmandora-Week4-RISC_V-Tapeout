# Circuit design and SPICE Simulation 

## Topics Covered :

### 1. Introduction to Circuit design and SPICE Simulation

### 2. NMOS Different regions of Operations

### 3. Introduction to SPICE

## 1. Introduction to Circuit design and SPICE Simulation :

* We have All logic gates available, like AND , OR, NOT, etc.. So All this logic cells are formed with NMOS and PMOS connection in very perticular fashion.

* By connecting all logic cells in perticular manner, and if it gives required functionality of gates or circuit then it is called as circuit design.

* Circuit design is like how we connect NMOS and PMOS in perticular fashion so that we can get the required functionality of the circuit.

* After this design that perticular circuit is fad in with waveforms to find the output characteristics, that is about SPICE simulation.

* So in above image the NMOS and PMOS are connected in perficular fashion and it works as CMOS inverter so that is one of the example of the circuit design.

## SPICE Simulation :

* In SPICE, as we fad in waveforms of NMOS and PMOS to the circuit , then we get waveform in SPICE simulation. The waveforms decides the delay of each cell. and based on delay values, we can tune the W/L ratio of each transistor in the circuit.

* SPICE involves characterizing the NOMS and PMOS transistor in detail, means any CMOS logic in detail.
